# The Project

There's really no point to this book if we're not building something.

We'll be making a "simple" Windows 8 App that has a couple of pages/sections.  We'll be working with:
- map views (via the [Bing Maps SDK](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/bb764f67-6b2c-4e14-b2d3-17477ae1eaca))
- dealing with Geo-location
- navigating between pages/sections of our app
- thrid party API integrations (Twitter/Facebook/FourSquare/OAuth)
- Other things...I'm still iterating on this book as you're reading this
