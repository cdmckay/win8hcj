# Default Files

In your application there are a few default files:

- default.html
- package.appxmanifest
- [css]
    - default.css
- [images]
    - logo.png
    - smalllogo.png
    - splashscreen.png
    - storelogo.png
- [js]
    - default.js

### 1. default.html

The main view/layout file of your app.  Your Windows 8 App will start off loading from this page first.

### 2. js/default.js

This is where your application really starts.  Your program kicks off in this file and this is also where the logic for your applications life cycle happens.

### 3. css/default.css

The main style file for your app.

### 4. package.appxmanifest

This is an essential file for your app.  It basically outlines details about your app that Visual Studio needs in order to build it.  Things such your app's name, essential images like app and Windows 8 Store icons and services/privileges that your app will need in order to run (i.e. network access).
